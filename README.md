# Research Paper Status

Welcome to the **Research Paper Status** repository! This repository provides real-time updates on the status of my research papers. I have created this repository to keep interested parties, including admissions committees and the academic community, informed about the status of the submissions. I will update the results here irrespective of the outcomes.
